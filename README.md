This code was used to generate the movie playlist [24 hours, 703,579 genetic variants, 2 million years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbYzvS45vYI&list=PL0elTBjXjW_7oDLwWQCaDxKPSzCus5fAB), which maps genetic variants from chromosome 22, as dated by Wohns et al. in (A unified genealogy of modern and ancient genomes)[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi8264].  DNA samples were collected from 3,754 people by the [Human Genome Diversity Project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115999/), the [Simons Genome Diversity Project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5161557/), and the [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750478/).  The world map is the [Bertin Projection (1953), as implemented by Philippe Rivière](https://visionscarto.net/bertin-projection-1953).  The chromosome map uses the [generalized Hilbert space-filling curve developed by Jakub Červený](https://github.com/jakubcerveny/gilbert).
