The first million years
of this video series

20
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
are pretty boring.

30
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Really.  It's like this
for a long time.

This is a teaser for a
5 part, 36 hour video series

50
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
mapping 1,030,937 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

60
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The variants were collected
from 3,754 people

70
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and their date of origin
was estimated by Wohns et al.

80
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
by building tree sequences
from all the samples.

90
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Part 1 of the series covers
from 2 million years ago

100
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:59,000

from 10,000 years ago

160
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:59,000
to 1,000 years ago.

170
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:14,000
