Welcome.

20
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first million years
of this video series

30
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
are pretty boring.

40
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Really.  It's like this
for a long time.

50
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is a teaser for a
5 part, 42 hour video series

60
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
mapping 1,228,178 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

70
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The variants were collected
from 3,754 people

80
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and their date of origin
was estimated by Wohns et al

90
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
by building family trees for
each snippet of chromosome,

100
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
79,969 trees in total
for chromosome 22.

110
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Part 1 of the series covers
from 2 million years ago...

120
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:59,000

130
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Part 2 of the series covers
from 75,000 years ago...

140
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:59,000

from 25,000 years ago...

160

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Part 4 of the series covers
from 10,000 years ago...

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:59,000

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Part 5 of the series covers
the final 1,000 years.

200
