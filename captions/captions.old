The first few hundred thousand years of this video...
...are pretty boring.

That's because human genetic variation...
...is pretty boring.

Almost every common genetic variant by itself...
...has a tiny effect, or no effect at all.

It takes hundreds of common genetic variants added together...
...to explain a fraction of the variance...
... in complex human traits like height, weight...

Each genetic variant by itself makes a miniscule contribution.

And those are the common genetic variants...
...with the <italic>biggest</italic> effect.

Since most single genetic variants have a tiny effect...
...or no effect at all...
...they're free to spread randomly.

That's what we're looking at right now.
Genetic variants which mostly don't do much...
...but have gotten lucky, again and again...
...and spread across the entire globe.
Later in the video we'll see genetic variants...
...which haven't gotten as lucky...
...or haven't had as much time to spread.

Let's pause (1m10s) and tell the story of one of the variants.
1,234,456 years ago...
...give or take a few hundred thousand years...
...someone had a cytosine (C) flip to a guanine (G)...
...at position 12,345,678 on chromosome 22.

It probably didn't make them any faster, or quieter...
...stronger, or smarter...
...more beautiful, or more conscientious...
...but they did pass it on to their kids...
...just by chance...
...who, just by chance, passed it on to their kids.
The genetic variant got lucky again and again...
...until almost everyone in the world had a copy.
You probably have a copy.

Why chromosome 22?  Because it's short.
If I included all the chromosomes...
...this video would be over two weeks long...
...and you might get bored.

I've arranged the video so that you can watch 5-6 minutes...
...at any given date...
...and get a couple of random round-the-world samples...
...for that date.

I've also posted a version of this video...
...with a bigger, more colourful map...
...but no academic citations.

You can slow down or speed up the video...
...using Youtube's playback speed option in the gear icon menu.
You might want to mute the audio if you do.

Keep in mind that this data is likely to change...
...as more genomes are sequenced and more analysis is done.

Enjoy.

We're at the final time step.

If a genetic variant has been found at two locations...
...we're drawing a line between them.
Each line will disappear after a minute or so.

/*
Keep in mind as you watch...
...that the patterns you see are shaped in part...
...by the places where researchers chose to take DNA samples.
*/

As you watch, think about how the map might look different...
...if researchers had sampled a different set of locations.
...if researchers had made different choices about where to sample.
...if researchers had spread their sampling differently.

You have to add up 610 common genetic variants...
...with the biggest effect on height...
...to explain 25% of the variance in height.
Each of the 610 variants by itself...
...makes a miniscule contribution.


For cognitive performance, you have to add up 1,271
...with the biggest effect...
...to explain 7-10% of the variance.
Each of the 1,271 common genetic variants by itself...
...makes a miniscule contribution.


No common genetic variant by itself...
####...explains more than 0.2% of the variance... ###more accurate to talk about "added together"
...in traits like height, weight...

Almost all genetic variants...
...with a tiny handful of exceptions...
...do even less than that.

Most of the headlines you've seen in the past...
...about a "gene for this" or a "gene for that"...
...have turned out to be wrong.

When we see a big heritable genetic effect...
...it's probably hundreds of tiny genetic effects added up...
...or, sometimes, a rare variant with a big effect.

Since most single genetic variants have a tiny effect...
...they're free to spread randomly.

That's what we're mostly looking at right now.
Genetic variants which don't do much...
...but have gotten lucky, again and again...
...and spread across the entire globe.

Let's pause and tell the story of one of the variants.
