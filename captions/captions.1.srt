10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome.

20
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first million years
of this video series

30
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
are pretty boring.

40
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's because most
human genetic variation

50
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is pretty boring.

60
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Almost every common
genetic variant

70
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
has a tiny effect,
or no effect at all.

80
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It takes hundreds of common
variants added together

90
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
to explain a fraction of the
variance in complex traits

100
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
like height, weight, schooling,
or psychiatric diagnosis.

110
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Each genetic variant by itself
makes a tiny contribution.

120
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And those are the common
genetic variants

130
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
with the biggest effect.

140
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Since most variants have a
tiny effect by themselves

150
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
they're free to spread
more-or-less randomly.

160
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's what we're mostly
looking at right now:

170
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Genetic variants which
don't do much

180
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but have gotten lucky
again and again

190
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and spread across
the entire globe.

200
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Later in the video series
we'll see genetic variants

210
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
which haven't
been as lucky

220
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or haven't had as
much time to spread.

230
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is part 1 of
a 5-part video series

240
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
mapping 1,030,937 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

250
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This part covers variants from
2 million to 75,000 years ago.

260
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
These genetic variants were
collected from 3,754 people

270
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
by the Human Genome
Diversity Project,

280
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the Simons Genome
Diversity Project,

290
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and the 1000
Genomes Project.

300
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Dates when the variants
first appeared in humans

310
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
were estimated by
Wohns et al. in their paper

320
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
"A unified genealogy of
modern and ancient genomes."

330
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The map shows where
the variants were found

340
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
in modern populations.

350
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The video's border is a map
of the chromosome itself.

360
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Date estimates may change
as more data is collected

370
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and analytical techniques
are refined.

380
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Genetic variants found
in only one individual

390
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
or whose derived and
ancestral states were equal

400
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
have not been included
in these videos,

410
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and dates have
been rounded.

420
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Many human groups are
not represented

430
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so be aware of gaps
in the data.

440
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Enjoy.
