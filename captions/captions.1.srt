10
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome.

20
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first million years
of this video series

30
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
are pretty boring.

40
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's because most
human genetic variation

50
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
is pretty boring.

60
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Almost every common
genetic variant

70
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
has a tiny effect,
or no effect at all.

80
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It takes hundreds of common
variants added together

90
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to explain a fraction of the
variance in complex traits

100
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
like height, weight, schooling,
or psychiatric diagnosis.

110
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Each genetic variant by itself
makes a tiny contribution.

120
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Since most common variants
have a tiny effect

130
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
they're free to spread
more-or-less randomly.

140
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's what we're mostly
looking at right now:

150
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Genetic variants which
don't do much

160
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
but which have gotten
lucky again and again

170
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and spread across
the entire globe.

180
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Later in the video series
we'll see genetic variants

190
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which haven't
been as lucky

200
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or haven't had as
much time to spread.

210
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is part 1 of
a 5-part video series

220
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
mapping 703,579 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

230
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This part covers variants from
2 million to 100,000 years ago.

240
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
These genetic variants were
collected from 3,754 people

250
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
by the Human Genome
Diversity Project,

260
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the Simons Genome
Diversity Project,

270
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and the 1000
Genomes Project.

280
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Dates when the variants
first appeared in humans

290
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
were estimated by
Wohns et al. in their paper

300
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
"A unified genealogy of
modern and ancient genomes."

310
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The map shows where
the variants were found

320
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
in modern populations.

330
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The video's border is a map
of the chromosome itself.

340
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Date estimates may change
as more data is collected

350
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and analytical techniques
are refined.

360
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Genetic variants found
in only one individual

370
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
have not been included
in these videos,

380
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and dates have
been rounded.

390
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Many human groups are
not represented

400
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
so be aware of gaps
in the data.

410
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Enjoy.
