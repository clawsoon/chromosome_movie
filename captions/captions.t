The first million years
of this video series

are pretty boring.

Really.  It's like this
for a long time.

This is a teaser for a
5 part, 36 hour video series

mapping 1,030,937 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

The variants were collected
from 3,754 people

and their date of origin
was estimated by Wohns et al.

by building tree sequences
from all the samples.

Part 1 of the series covers
from 2 million years ago

to 75,000 years ago.

Part 2 of the series covers
from 75,000 years ago

to 20,000 years ago.

Part 3 of the series covers
from 20,000 years ago

to 10,000 years ago.

Part 4 of the series covers
from 10,000 years ago

to 1,000 years ago.

Part 5 of the series covers
the final 1,000 years.

Enjoy.
