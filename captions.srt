00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is part one of
a series of four videos

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
showing the current
geographic locations of

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
1,086,919 genetic variants
from chromosome 22.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This video covers
the period

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
from 2.2 million years ago
to 50,000 years ago.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The date on the
bottom is an estimate

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of when the
genetic variant arose.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The red dots show where
a genetic variant

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
has been found in
a modern population.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The treble clef
(and the matching music)

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
indicates what the
DNA change was.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The squiggly line
around the outside

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is the chromosome.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The orange dot shows
the variant's location

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
on the chromosome.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
"Site" is the exact
location of the variant

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
on the chromosome.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
"Count" shows where you
are in the video series.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Each population where a
genetic variant was found

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
is listed in
the small print.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
These genetic variants
were collected by

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the Simons Genome
Diversity Project

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the Human Genome
Diversity Project

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and the 1000
Genomes Project.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Dates were estimated by
Wohns et al. in

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
"A unified genealogy of
modern and ancient genomes."

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The world map is
Philippe Rivière's re-creation

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
of Bertin's 1953 projection.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The chromsome map
uses Jakub Červený's

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
generalized Hilbert
space-filling curve.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Enjoy.
