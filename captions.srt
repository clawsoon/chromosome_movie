10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome.

20
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is part 5 of
a 5-part video series

30
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
mapping 1,086,919 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

40
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This video covers variants
which appeared recently.

50
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
These genetic variants were
collected from 3,754 people

60
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
by the Simons Genome
Diversity Project,

70
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the Human Genome
Diversity Project,

80
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the 1000
Genomes Project.

90
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dates when the variants
first appeared in humans

100
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
were estimated by
Wohns et al. in their paper

110
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
"A unified genealogy of
modern and ancient genomes."

120
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
These estimates will change
as more data is collected

130
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and analytical techniques
are refined.

140
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Enjoy.
