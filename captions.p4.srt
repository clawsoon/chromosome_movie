10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome.

20
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is part 4 of
a 5-part video series

30
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
mapping 1,030,937 genetic
variants from chromosome 22.

40
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Part 4 covers variants from
10,000 to 1,000 years ago.

50
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
These genetic variants were
collected from 3,754 people

60
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
by the Simons Genome
Diversity Project,

70
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the Human Genome
Diversity Project,

80
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and the 1000
Genomes Project.

90
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dates when the variants
first appeared in humans

100
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
were estimated by
Wohns et al. in their paper

110
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
"A unified genealogy of
modern and ancient genomes."

120
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The map shows where
the variants were found

130
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in modern populations.

140
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The video's border is a map
of the chromosome itself.

150
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
These estimates may change
as more data is collected

160
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and analytical techniques
are refined.

170
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Genetic variants found
in only one individual

180
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
or whose derived and
ancestral states were equal

190
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
have not been included
in this video,

200
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and dates have
been rounded.

210
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Many human groups are
not represented

220
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
so be aware of gaps
in the data.

230
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Enjoy.
